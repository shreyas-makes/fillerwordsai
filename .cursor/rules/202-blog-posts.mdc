# Speedrail Blog Post Management

## Context
- When creating or managing blog posts
- When handling blog post assets and slugs

## Requirements
- Use generate_unique_slug for URL-friendly slugs
- Handle assets through Active Storage
- Configure proper storage service in development
- Implement proper validation for required fields
- Use proper asset storage configuration

## Examples
<example>
```ruby
# Proper blog post creation with slug generation
blog_post = BlogPost.new(
  title: "My Blog Post",
  content: "Content here",
  cover_image: params[:cover_image]
)
blog_post.save # Automatically generates unique slug
```
</example>

<example type="invalid">
```ruby
# Don't skip slug generation
blog_post = BlogPost.new(
  title: "My Blog Post",
  content: "Content here"
)
blog_post.slug = "my-blog-post" # Manual slug assignment is discouraged
```
</example>

## Critical Rules
  - Always use generate_unique_slug for URL generation
  - Configure proper storage service in config/storage.yml
  - Handle assets through Active Storage
  - Validate required fields (except cover_image)
  - Use proper development storage configuration
