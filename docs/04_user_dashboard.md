# User Dashboard Implementation

## Overview
In this step, we'll create the user dashboard that displays processing history, video status, and provides access to processed files. This is the central interface where users will manage their videos.

## Task
Implement the user dashboard with video history, processing status indicators, and download functionality.

## Specific Steps

1. Create a dashboard controller:
   - Implement routes for the dashboard
   - Create controller actions to list videos
   - Add filtering and sorting options
   - Implement pagination for video history

2. Create dashboard views:
   - Design the main dashboard layout
   - Create video card components for each video
   - Implement processing status indicators
   - Add download buttons for completed videos
   - Create before/after comparison view

3. Add realtime status updates:
   - Implement Stimulus.js controllers for live updates
   - Create controller endpoints for status polling
   - Update progress indicators in real-time
   - Show estimated time remaining

4. Implement download functionality:
   - Create routes for downloading processed files
   - Add controller actions to handle downloads
   - Add tracking for download counts

5. Create video preview functionality:
   - Implement video player for original and processed videos
   - Add comparison view to show differences
   - Implement video controls

## Expected Outcome
A complete user dashboard that allows users to:
- View their uploaded videos
- Track processing status with realtime updates
- Download processed videos
- Compare original and processed versions

## Testing Approach
1. Unit tests:
   - Test controller actions
   - Test helper methods

2. Integration tests:
   - Test dashboard rendering with various video statuses
   - Test filtering and sorting
   - Test download functionality

3. System tests:
   - Test realtime updates with simulated processing
   - Test full user flow from upload to download
