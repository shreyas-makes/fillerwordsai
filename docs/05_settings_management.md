# User Settings Management

## Overview
In this step, we'll implement the settings management functionality where users can customize their filler word blacklist and silence threshold.

## Task
Create a settings interface for users to customize processing parameters and store these preferences in their user profile.

## Specific Steps

1. Create a settings controller:
   - Implement routes for settings management
   - Create controller actions to view and update settings
   - Handle parameter validation

2. Create settings views:
   - Design the settings form interface
   - Create filler word management UI (add/remove words)
   - Add silence threshold adjustment slider
   - Implement form validation

3. Update User model:
   - Add methods to manage custom filler words
   - Add validation for silence threshold
   - Create default settings initialization
   - Implement settings serialization/deserialization

4. Create settings persistence:
   - Add database storage for user settings
   - Implement settings retrieval on login
   - Ensure settings are applied to new video processing

5. Add settings preview functionality:
   - Create a way to demonstrate settings effects
   - Create example snippets to show threshold effects
   - Add help text and visual aids

## Expected Outcome
A complete settings management system that allows users to:
- Add and remove custom filler words
- Adjust silence threshold
- Save their preferences for future uploads
- Apply different settings to different videos

## Testing Approach
1. Unit tests:
   - Test settings persistence
   - Test validation rules
   - Test serialization/deserialization

2. Integration tests:
   - Test settings form submission
   - Test settings retrieval
   - Test application of settings to video processing

3. System tests:
   - Test full settings management flow
   - Test persistence between sessions
