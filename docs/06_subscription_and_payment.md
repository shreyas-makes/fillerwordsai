# Subscription and Payment Integration

## Overview
In this step, we'll implement the subscription and payment system using Stripe to allow users to purchase plans and manage their subscriptions.

## Task
Implement the subscription model with monthly and one-time payment options, integrate with Stripe, and add quota tracking.

## Specific Steps

1. Configure Stripe integration:
   - Set up Stripe API keys in credentials
   - Configure webhooks for subscription events
   - Create product and price IDs in Stripe dashboard

2. Create subscription controller:
   - Implement routes for subscription management
   - Create controller actions for subscription creation
   - Add webhook handling for Stripe events
   - Implement subscription cancellation

3. Create subscription views:
   - Design the pricing page
   - Create checkout flow
   - Implement subscription management UI
   - Add payment method management

4. Implement quota tracking:
   - Add methods to check remaining credits
   - Create logic to decrement credits on video processing
   - Implement unlimited processing for monthly subscribers
   - Add credit refresh logic for one-time payment users

5. Create subscription status indicators:
   - Add subscription status to user dashboard
   - Create credit remaining indicators
   - Implement subscription expiration notices
   - Add upgrade prompts for users on quota limits

## Expected Outcome
A complete subscription system that allows users to:
- Purchase monthly unlimited plans ($30/month)
- Make one-time payments ($150 for 10 videos)
- Track remaining credits
- Manage their subscription

## Testing Approach
1. Unit tests:
   - Test subscription logic
   - Test quota tracking
   - Test Stripe webhook handling

2. Integration tests:
   - Test subscription creation flow
   - Test payment processing with Stripe test mode
   - Test subscription cancellation

3. System tests:
   - Test full subscription lifecycle
   - Test credit tracking across multiple videos
