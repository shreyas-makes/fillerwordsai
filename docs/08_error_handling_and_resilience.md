# Error Handling and System Resilience

## Overview
In this step, we'll implement comprehensive error handling, retry mechanisms, and system resilience features to ensure the application can recover from failures and provide users with helpful error messages.

## Task
Implement error handling, retry logic, and resilience features throughout the application.

## Specific Steps

1. Implement upload error handling:
   - Create validation error displays for file uploads
   - Add network failure recovery
   - Implement upload resume functionality
   - Create meaningful error messages for users

2. Add processing error handling:
   - Implement automatic retry for failed MediaConvert jobs
   - Create error classification system
   - Add detailed error logging
   - Implement user-friendly error messaging

3. Create system resilience features:
   - Add background job retry with exponential backoff
   - Implement circuit breaker for AWS service calls
   - Add monitoring for system bottlenecks
   - Create failover mechanisms for essential services

4. Implement transaction safety:
   - Ensure database transactions are properly handled
   - Add data integrity checks
   - Implement idempotent operations
   - Add crash recovery mechanisms

5. Create user notifications for errors:
   - Add error notifications in the dashboard
   - Implement status updates for retried operations
   - Create support request functionality for persistent errors
   - Add self-help troubleshooting guides

## Expected Outcome
A robust application that can:
- Handle errors gracefully
- Recover from transient failures
- Provide helpful error messages to users
- Maintain data integrity during failures

## Testing Approach
1. Unit tests:
   - Test error handling logic
   - Test retry mechanisms

2. Integration tests:
   - Test recovery from simulated AWS failures
   - Test upload error scenarios
   - Test processing failure recovery

3. Chaos tests:
   - Test application behavior under stress
   - Test recovery from database connection issues
   - Test handling of partial system failures
